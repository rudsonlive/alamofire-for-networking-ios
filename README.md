# Sample with Alamofire
Using the library Alamofire

Alamofire is a study project for IOS using Swift.<br>
The project has four screens (List, Details, Map and WebSite)<br>

<a href="https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire">Alamofire</a> used the library to make the request and get the json. Using the library <a href="https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/AlamofireObjectMapper">AlamofireObjectMapper</a> I do parse the json to my Companies object.<br>

Everything in the design is very simple and there are some comments in the code for better understanding of some functionality.<br>

You can see how the project was going to the <a href="https://github.com/rudsonlive/alamofire-for-networking-ios/tree/master/Image/screenshot">screenshot folder (Iphone 6s plus)</a>.

I hope that this project can help other developers like me who are starting in the world IOS.<br>
